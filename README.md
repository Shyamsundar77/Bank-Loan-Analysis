# Customer Bank_Loan_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer loan data from the Finance datasets, `Finance_1.xlsx` and `Finance_2.xlsx`. The aim is to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) to gain insights into loan trends and customer behavior in the finance domain.

## Datasets
- **Finance_1.xlsx**
- **Finance_2.xlsx**

**Datasets Type:** Excel CSV Data

## KPIs
1. **Year-wise Loan Amount Trends**
2. **Grade and Sub-Grade Wise Revolving Balance**
3. **Total Payment for Verified Status vs. Total Payment for Non-Verified Status**
4. **State-wise and Month-wise Loan Status**
5. **Home Ownership vs. Last Payment Date**

## Project Details
The analysis includes cleaning raw data in Excel, extracting KPIs using SQL, and visualizing insights through Power BI and Tableau.

## Challenges
- **Date Formats:** Handling date formats was a significant challenge during data processing, especially when transitioning data between Excel and SQL.
- **Understanding Attributes:** Gaining domain knowledge to understand the attributes in the data was crucial for meaningful analysis.

## Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Year-wise Loan Amount Trends
- **Insight:** The loan amounts show consistent growth year over year, indicating an increase in borrowing trends.
- **Analysis:** A spike in loan amounts was observed in certain years, possibly due to favorable economic conditions or changes in lending policies.
- **Recommendation:** Analyze the factors that led to this increase to forecast future lending trends.

### 2. Grade and Sub-Grade Wise Revolving Balance
- **Insight:** Higher credit grades tend to have lower revolving balances, indicating better financial management by customers with higher credit scores.
- **Analysis:** Customers in lower credit grades are more likely to have higher revolving balances, suggesting potential risk for lenders.
- **Recommendation:** Focus on managing and reducing revolving balances in lower credit grades through targeted financial advice or refinancing options.

### 3. Verified vs Non-Verified Status Total Payment
- **Insight:** Verified customers have a higher total payment amount compared to non-verified customers.
- **Analysis:** Verification status appears to correlate with more significant repayment behavior, which could be due to stricter lending criteria for verified loans.
- **Recommendation:** Encourage customers to verify their status to improve loan performance and reduce default rates.

### 4. State-wise and Month-wise Loan Status
- **Insight:** Certain states show higher default rates, while others maintain healthier loan statuses.
- **Analysis:** Loan performance varies significantly across states, which may be influenced by local economic conditions and employment rates.
- **Recommendation:** Tailor lending strategies based on state-level performance and offer more flexible repayment options in higher-risk regions.

### 5. Home Ownership vs Last Payment Date
- **Insight:** Homeowners tend to have more consistent and timely payments compared to non-homeowners.
- **Analysis:** Home ownership status could be a strong indicator of financial stability, which influences payment behavior.
- **Recommendation:** Consider offering special incentives or better rates to homeowners, as they demonstrate lower risk.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer loan behavior and trends, enabling data-driven decisions for lenders. Future work could focus on developing predictive models to forecast loan performance based on historical data.
